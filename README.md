## Project Overview

I wanted to answer a straightforward question: which hospitals, states, and conditions are driving the worst 30-day readmission rates in the U.S.?

I pulled real CMS data, wrote a Python ETL script to clean and load 18,330 records into a normalized MySQL database, ran five analytical queries to find the patterns, and built a Power BI dashboard to present the findings. The whole pipeline — data to dashboard — is in this repo.

## Database Schema

Three normalized tables with foreign key constraints:

```sql
hospitals (
    facility_id     VARCHAR(10)   PRIMARY KEY,
    facility_name   VARCHAR(255),
    state           VARCHAR(5)
)

conditions (
    condition_id    INT           PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    measure_name    VARCHAR(255)
)

readmissions (
    id                          INT           PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    facility_id                 VARCHAR(10)   FK → hospitals,
    condition_id                INT           FK → conditions,
    excess_readmission_ratio    DECIMAL(6,4),
    predicted_rate              DECIMAL(5,2),
    expected_rate               DECIMAL(5,2),
    number_of_readmissions      INT,
    number_of_discharges        INT
)
```

**Data volume:** 3,055 hospitals · 6 conditions · 18,330 readmission records

## ETL Pipeline

`load_data.py` handles the full ingestion workflow:

1. Parses the raw CMS `.numbers` file using `numbers-parser`
2. Cleans and coerces numeric fields — handles `N/A`, `Too Few to Report`, and `NaN` values
3. Splits the flat file into 3 normalized tables
4. Loads into MySQL via `mysql-connector-python` with foreign key integrity

```bash
pip install numbers-parser mysql-connector-python pandas
python load_data.py
```

## SQL Analysis

### Q1 — Top 10 States by Excess Readmission Ratio
Identifies which states have the highest average readmission burden across all facilities.  
**Finding:** Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Florida rank highest nationally.

### Q2 — Readmissions by Condition
Aggregates total readmissions and average excess ratio by clinical condition.  
**Finding:** Heart Failure drives the most readmissions at 392K+, followed by Pneumonia at 131K.

### Q3 — Hospital Performance vs. National Average
Uses CASE WHEN logic to categorize each hospital as better, worse, or same as national benchmark.  
**Finding:** 69% of hospitals perform better than the national average.

### Q4 — Highest Risk Hospitals
Ranks hospitals by average excess readmission ratio across all tracked conditions.  
**Finding:** Surgical specialty hospitals dominate the top 10 highest-risk list.

### Q5 — Predicted vs. Expected Rate Gap by State & Condition
Surfaces where actual performance diverges most from model expectations.  
**Finding:** Wyoming CABG and Massachusetts AMI show the largest rate gaps.

## Power BI Dashboard

Connected directly to MySQL via MySQL Connector/NET.

| Visual | Description |
|---|---|
| KPI Cards | Total hospitals, total readmissions, avg excess ratio, conditions tracked |
| Bar Chart | Top 10 states by average excess readmission ratio |
| Bar Chart | Total discharges by clinical condition |
| Donut Chart | Hospital performance vs. national average |
| Table | Top 10 highest risk hospitals |

**DAX Calculated Column:**

```dax
Performance Category = 
IF(readmissions[excess_readmission_ratio] < 1, "Better Than National",
IF(readmissions[excess_readmission_ratio] > 1, "Worse Than National",
"Same As National"))
```

## Key Findings

- **MA, NJ, FL** have the highest average excess readmission ratios nationally
- **Heart Failure** is the single largest driver of readmissions at 392K+
- **48% of hospitals** perform worse than the national benchmark
- **Surgical specialty hospitals** are disproportionately represented among highest-risk facilities
- **Wyoming CABG** shows the largest gap between predicted and expected readmission rates
